# daylemma

## Version 01 of the project

A daily dose of tough choices: chocolate or coffee? Being able to fly or become inivisible? Always 10 minutes late or always 20 minutes early?
The twist? You can only choose once. Face one new day-lemma every 24h.

## Goals of the app

It aims to be a social app that doesn't have you doom-scrolling for hours or alert for new potential messages. Three key points:

- Quick and meaningful interaction
- Reduced stress
- Focus on fun and thought-provoking decisions

Many new features are already planned (with some in development) to enhance this approach. Some of them are:

- Friend requests and display of only friends votes.
- Monetization features with extra options such as creation of own daylemmas for friends, chat with friends and avatar personalization.
